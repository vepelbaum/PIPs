The general Function
the argument is the seed. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

art <- function(x){
  require(jasmines)
  require(dplyr)
  use_seed(x) %>%
    entity_heart(grain = 1000)  %>%
    unfold_tempest(iterations = 100) %>%
    style_ribbon(background = "oldlace",
                 colour = "ind"
    )
}

art(1)
```


Changing elements:
entity_heart creates a heart shape. In the following example I changed it to circle

```{r}

art <- function(x){
  require(jasmines)
  require(dplyr)
  use_seed(x) %>%
    entity_circle(grain = 1000)  %>%  ## entity enetity
    unfold_tempest(iterations = 5) %>% ## this is the amount of iterations
    style_ribbon(background = "oldlace", ## the background color
                 colour = "ind"  # the color of the object
    )
}

art(1)


```
